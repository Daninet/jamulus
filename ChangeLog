0.9.4

- implemented protocol, now it is possible to set the jitter buffer in the
  server according to the setting in the client (they are coupled now)

- removed sample rate offset estimation since it was not used anyway

- internal audio processing in the server is now based on minimum block
  size (improves latency)
