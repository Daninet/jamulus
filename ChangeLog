2.2.0

- added Jack audio interface (Linux)

- simplified settings dialog, complete redesign (removed sound card
  buffer settings, network block sizes settings, added upload rate display)

- improved audio stability (audio interface is not callback based, removed
  intermediate audio buffers, client audio buffer size equals network
  buffer size now)

- added upload rate limitation for server (server decides which network
  parameters to use depending on the upload limit and the number of connected
  clients)


2.1.4

- added automatic jitter buffer size setting

- speed optimizations to improve audio interface stability

- new defaults (e.g. turn off Reverb by default since it requires significant
  CPU)


2.1.3

- added sound card selection

- added total delay display

- improved ASIO configuration


2.1.2

- audio compression type can be selected (IMA ADPCM, MS ADPCM, None)

- ping time measurement problems on Windows OS fixed

- security checks for protocol messages (wrong messages could crash the
  software)


2.1.1

- chat window

- server can be started on different port

- client can select port of server

- ping time information in general settings dialog


2.1.0

- ASIO support


2.0.0

- first QT4 compatible release


0.9.9

- new client settings dialog

- at each client a separate audio mix can be generated for all connected clients
  at the server


0.9.4

- implemented protocol, now it is possible to set the jitter buffer in the
  server according to the setting in the client (they are coupled now)

- removed sample rate offset estimation since it was not used anyway

- internal audio processing in the server is now based on minimum block
  size (improves latency)


0.9.1

- initial version
