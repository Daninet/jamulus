Windows:
--------

Rquired software: QT, a compiler like Visual Studio, ASIO development files

- copy ASIO development files in llcon/windows directory so that, e.g., the
  directory llcon\windows\ASIOSDK2\common exists
- open llcon.pro in Qt Creator and compile


Linux:
------

Required packages: QT4 (devel packages, too!), Jack (devel packages, too!)

- cd llcon
- qmake llcon.pro
- make
- run ./llcon

Use qmake "CONFIG+=nosound" llcon.pro for pure server installation which
does not require the Jack packages.


Mac:
----

- cd llcon
- qmake -spec /usr/local/Qt4.6/mkspecs/macx-g++ -macx -o Makefile llcon.pro
- make
- run ./llcon

NOTE: You may have to adjust the Qt4.x path to your Qt version
