Windows:
--------

Rquired software: QT 2 non-commercial, Visual C++ 6.0

- run llcon/windows/MocQT.bat
- open llcon.dsw in your Visual C++ 6.0 environment and compile
- run llcon/windows/Release/llcon.exe

------

Required packages: QT (devel packages, too!), ALSA (devel packages, too!)

- cd llcon
- sh bootstrap
- ./configure
- make
- run llcon/linux/llcon

NOTES:
- it may be required by your Linux distrubution that you set the QTDIR
  environment variable prior to the "./configure" call. E.g., for SUSE:
