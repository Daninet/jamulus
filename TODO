HIGH PRIORITY

- Auto jitter buffer algorithm needs to be revised and optimized (maybe
  using a histogram instead of calculating the standard deviation is
  more suitable to set the optimum jitter buffer size since the variance
  of the jitter is not Gaussian but follows some other unknown distribution)

- Channel gains are not transported to the server if the server
  was closed and reopend during a client connection (this issue has to be
  investigated in more detail, it seems that sometimes the gain is still
  valid even if the server was shutdown and restarted...)


LOW PRIORITY

- Disconnect functionality requires some more work -> does not work reliably

- Fancy GUI design is almost finished but has some issues (update problem
  in Windows, size of fader background seems to be differently interpreted
  in Linux and Windows)
