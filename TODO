HIGH PRIORITY

- Auto jitter buffer algorithm needs to be revised and optimized

- Channel gains and client name is not transported to the server if the server
  was closed and reopend during a client connection


LOW PRIORITY

- Disconnect functionality requires some more work -> does not work reliably
