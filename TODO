HIGH PRIORITY ------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improvement of Jitter Buffer
  Right now in case of a buffer over-/underrun the jitter buffer is reset
  and the pointer is set to the middle of the buffer. This is a good
  compromise for most situations but leads to problems if very small jitter
  buffer sizes are used. An optimized pointer position in case of buffer
  failures will improve the performance on very small buffer sizes.

- Support for Stereo Audio Streams
  * Wait for CELT code domain mixing feature.
  * Preserve mono mode for low CPU usage at the server and low up-/download
    rate at the client.
  * Server switches to stereo on first client which is connected and has
    stereo mode enabled.  

- Detect Server on Same Computer
  Detect that a server is running on the same computer by trying to bind the
  server socket port. If a server is running, ask the client user if
  "localhost" shall be substituted on the host address edit box.
  -> Aids server operation on client PC.

- Auto Jitter Buffer Algorithm Improvement
  Auto jitter buffer algorithm needs to be revised and optimized (maybe
  using a histogram instead of calculating the standard deviation is
  more suitable to set the optimum jitter buffer size since the variance
  of the jitter is not Gaussian but follows some other unknown distribution).

- Bug With Channel Gains
  Channel gains are not transported to the server if the server was closed
  and reopend during a client connection (this issue has to be investigated
  in more detail, it seems that sometimes the gain is still valid even if the
  server was shutdown and restarted...).

- Mac Port
  Porting the llcon software so that it can be run on MacOS. QT is already
  available on Mac, even a Jack port is there. But it might be better to use
  the native Mac audio interface Core Audio. A new audio interface should be
  written.


LOW PRIORITY -------------------------------------------------------------------

- Disconnect issue
  Disconnect functionality requires some more work -> does not work reliably

- Fancy GUI Design Implementation
  Fancy GUI design is almost finished but has some issues (update problem
  in Windows, size of fader background seems to be differently interpreted
  in Linux and Windows).
